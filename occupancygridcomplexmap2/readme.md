A map is read using map_server. 
The problem is to change the 1D map data to xy data. This is how A_star algorithm works.

Select a start position by the help of 2D pose estimate button on Rviz screen.
Then, choose a 2D Nav Goal as the final destination again on the Rviz screen.
After that wait to see the destination green to find the best route for you.
But i didn't add the cross move.
