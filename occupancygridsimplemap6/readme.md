A simple map is created using OccupancyGrid message type

Select a start position by the help of 2D pose estimate button on Rviz screen. Then, choose a 2D Nav Goal as the final destination again on the Rviz screen. After that wait to see the destination green to find the best route for you. But i didn't add the cross move.
